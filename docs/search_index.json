Technical translation was used for acceleration. Forewords In August 2020, I had the opportunity to teach Euclid’s Elements, and the teaching of the first volume lasted about 3 months and took about 30 teaching hours. I took notes before and after each class. This teaching note is recommended to be read in conjunction with Euclid’s Elements, particularly If you are not familiar with the geometry, you may need to preview all the propositions first. Note: The first ten lessons will last between one and one and a half hours, and from the eleventh lesson onwards, the lessons will last between one and a half and two hours. There are review sessions in between that are not counted, and the total teaching time should be around 30 hours. The study journey of the first volume of Euclid’s Elements started in August 2020. Prologue Mathematics is a fundamental subject that is required for every student. However, the learning style varies and in the traditional classroom (China), students learn formulas, operations, and other laws as a recipient, while exams are given to see if students can apply what they have learned and solve problems correctly. In my discussion class of Euclid, it is not about asking students to master or memorize any single definition or proposition, but to go into the source of mathematics together to observe and explore its original formation. If mathematics is a skyscraper today, the point of the discussion is to pick up the shovel and carefully shovel away the soil to observe the original foundation: How was it designed? What was the thinking behind it? Is there anything that can be questioned or overturned? What are the basic laws of “mathematics” as a discipline here? All of these questions are open-ended, and the answers will vary with the degree of individual learning. Because the student may not be used to the discussion class, I do not start with the definition section at the beginning. Imagine that you ask students on the first day of class, “A point has no parts,” what is a “part”? Such a question would probably not be understood, even sounds weird to an adult, and would be very metaphysical. Thus I planned to start with the proposition which is similar to the geometry math problem in middle school, and then go back and discuss the definition in reverse. For this discussion class, they were just Alex and I. In the summer of 2020, Alex was a middle school student, living in Shanghai, and he was preparing his second year of middle school. Because he is a gifted student, he had skipped two grades in elementary school, and was slightly younger than the students in his class. Since I was in Europe, all the discussions have been delivered through online teaching. I would like to thank Angela (Alex’ mother) for her support and trust. Without her, Alex and I would not put aside the test-based math studies and we could not spend our time exploring math freely. With a grateful heart, I have recorded my ideas and thoughts about the lessons in my notebook. "],["discussion-i-prop1.html", "Chapter 1 Discussion I (Prop1)", " Chapter 1 Discussion I (Prop1) On a given finite straight line to construct an equilateral triangle. Before the first discussion, I have asked Alex to read through the proof in advance. In class, since Alex had already thought about the proof, he made the equilateral triangle by drawing a circle in the same way as Euclid did. Only near the end, I remind him that the last step is not “so triangle ABC is an equilateral triangle”, instead, we must declare that the equilateral triangle ABC is constructed on AB. The reason for this is simple: Proposition 1 states that “On a given finite straight line to construct an equilateral triangle”, then the construction of an equilateral triangle is only considered to be half part of it, to complete the proof, we must also state that this equilateral triangle is on this assigned finite line. After the first proof is complete, we begin to examine it carefully together. We notice that after drawing the circle there will be a marker [Axiom 3]. There are four marks in the whole proposition. [Postulate 3] (Axiom 3: To describe a circle with any centre and distance.) [Postulate 1] (Axiom 1: To draw a straight line from any point to any point.) [Definition 15] (Definition 15: A circle is a plane figure contained by one line such that all the straight lines falling upon it from one point among those lying within the figure are equal to one another) [Common notion 1] (Axiom 1: Things which are equal to the same thing are also equal to one another.) This is where our discussion begins. What is the difference between a postulate and a common notion? The English word postulate rooted in the Latin postulare, the original ancient Greek word αιτηματα, (αιτεω) means, to ask, to beg. Why is it that a straight line can be drawn between any two points is a postulate, particularly, obtained by begging? This question may seem a bit meaningless, but it is not difficult to understand. Let’s ask this question: Is it possible to draw a curve between two points? Can an infinite number of different kinds of lines be drawn? The answer is yes. Any two points, to connect the line in the middle, you can make it like whatever you want. In that case, is a straight line the most special and hard-to-get one among millions of other shapes? Isn’t the universalization of a small probability event what we are begging from God for a higher purpose? Common notions are not quite the same. For the English word common notion, the original ancient Greek root is κοιναι εννοιαι, the former means being common, universal; and the latter refers to a mark, an idea, a concept, etc. Is there any possibility other than “Things which are equal to the same thing are also equal to one another” ? Is there an example of two things equal to the same thing that are not equal to each other? This is undoubtedly very difficult. After all, Euclid only included 5 common notions, and not every widely accepted universal law is listed in the book, the reason and the logic for this pick is left for discussion later. At this moment, Alex and I have agreed to consider that the postulate is the realization of one of the innumerable possibilities, and the common notions are statements of certain universal truths. Based on this, it is not difficult to understand Postulate 3. Can a circle be drawn only if its center and distance are determined? This is just the way to draw a circle according to the definition of the circle. It may be difficult to imagine another way to draw a circle, but it does not prove that it does not exist. If an animal follows some biological behavior and leaves a trace of a circle on the ground with neither a center nor a distance, it does not deny that it is not a circle (although it seems difficult to prove that it is a circle too) Let’s look closer at the definition of a circle. “A circle is a plane figure contained by one line such that all the straight lines falling upon it from one point among those lying within the figure are equal to one another” When we think about a circle, is the circle that line or the figure inside the line, or are the two inseparable? Is a circular iron ring a circle? Is a circular clock plane a circle? What is the connection between the purely mathematical concept of a circle and the figurative reality? This being said, it is also important to think together about what a definition is and why we need it. A very modern example is discussed here with Alex. Probably everyone knows exactly what a computer refers to, but how do we describe a computer to someone who has never seen one before, if we travel back decades, centuries, or millennia? What is the best way to get the point across in a concise way? What kind of content needs to be included in the definition? Is it the style? Is it the nature of it? Is it an essential function? While talking about computers and tablets, I also had to mention Surface as a combined presence, and I invited Alex to think about why there is no word for “computer-tablet”, but rather the name of the product itself, Surface. This question seems to become easier when there is a realistic comparison. For computers, there are countless brands and styles, desktops, laptops - Apple, Lenovo, Alienware, etc. Computers are a general term for a broad category. And Surface occupied the market before many brands developed this type of products, thus its own name says all. If one day all brands launch a two-in-one existence of computer and tablet, among many different options, will a new term be born to refer to this category? Or is it the definition of the computer itself that is updated? There is never the answer for the questions in the discussion session, only opinions. The focus was not the delivery of the final answer but on the process of debate and reflection. For students who have been learning in a traditional classroom, the first step is to be able to speak up, to express himself, and to take the initiative. In addition to understanding these labels, there is another aspect of this proposition that can be questioned and often overlooked, and that is why do two circles intersect at point C. This can be logically broken down into two questions, firstly why do two circles intersect, and secondly why do they intersect at a point? (*This question can actually be extended to create an art installation. Two circles that do not intersect but are projected to intersect in 3D space.) Here the intersection of the two circles is implied by a condition: the two circles, drawn with the point A,B as the center of the circle respectively, are on the same plane. In fact, there are countless circles that can be drawn with A as the center and AB as the radius, and the same with B as the center, but if the two circles are intersected, they must be in the same plane. This condition is not stated by Euclid, but by default, when two circles are in the same plane and intersect, the intersecting part is the point, which is also self-evident, because the intersection of two circles is specifically pointed out as the intersection of two lines. But recall that a circle also includes a plane figure enclosed by a line. Is the intersection of a plane figure enclosed by a line not considered an intersection when it is invisible? What do you think about the problem discussed today?

"],["discussion-ii-prop2.html", "Chapter 2 Discussion II (Prop2)", " Chapter 2 Discussion II (Prop2) To place at a given point (as an extremity) a straight line equal to a given straight line. Today we will discuss Proposition 2 together. Alex first tried to prove this proposition by himself. His first attempt is to draw the point A and the line BC, and then use a compass as a medium to transfer the same distance as BC to the point A. After determining the two endpoints, the resulting line segment is equal to BC and A is one endpoint. It seems that in addition to the compass, a ruler can also help to achieve this transfer. However, it is important to note that the ruler was not marked in ancient Greece, and it was only used to assist in getting “straight”, not to measure on a scale. So let’s exclude the ruler option here. Based on Alex’s solution here, we need to understand why Euclid did not use a compass to “move” the line, instead, Eculid wrote a proposition to accomplish this task. I discuss this with Alex. To be short, there is no relative system that can guarantee the invariance of the quantity when the compass is used as the carrier of the quantity to be shifted. Unless we add a postulate in the beginning of the book, specifically for the application of this tool, to make similar actions universal. But this is excluded in Euclid’s consideration, because we can see the role of both the pass and the ruler is just to draw. Their missions do not involve the measurement of size etc. The compass is meant to draw circles, though we can be clever and take advantage to do other things, any function other than drawing circles is not recognized. Thus, here we choose to prove. If we go farther, let’s think about how geometry is related to the real world. In our observation of real life, are all the geometry shapes/objects geometric in the absolute sense? For example, if the cover of a book is worn and creased, is it still a rectangle? We often say that geometry is abstract, we can even say conceptual, that is, it is difficult to find absolute existence in life, while concrete things (figurative) connected to it are everywhere. Tools are more connected to figurative existence. In abstraction, without frame of reference, without judgment and means of verification, can we all agree to recognize that a certain act of transfer in humans’ minds is universal? Hardly. With Alex, we understand that the attempt of the compass may be operable in present life, but not in a rigorous abstract construction. Then we go back to Euclid’s proof of Proposition 2. The proof of Proposition 2 is not difficult, but there are two things about this problem that are worth taking a closer look. The first interesting question is about the inequality of the information contained in the image and the text. What does this mean? In Proposition 2, the comparison of the length of the given line segment BC and the connected line segment AB directly affects the presentation of the image. That is, the three cases of AB greater than BC, AB equal to BC and AB less than BC correspond to the three images, but the change of the images does not affect the writing of the text. In addition to the original editor’s illustration, there are two other possible illustrations. If we label the three cases with an equation, we will find that the magnitude of the quantity does not affect the logical reasoning either. Equivalence (AB=BC) Since BC=BD and DB=DA, DA=BC (Note that here it is not possible to write AB = BC directly) AB &gt; BC Because DL = DG, DA = DB, so AL(DL-DA) = BG(DG-DB) and because BG = BC So AL = BC AB &lt; BC Because DL = DG, DA = DB, so AL(DL-DA) = BG(DG-DB) and because BG = BC So AL = BC In this way, what kind of information does the image convey to us? The second part that I want to introduce to Alex here is an example of how to understand a geometric proof by memory, using Proposition 2 as an example. Looking at the complete argument of Proposition 2 and it contains a very long text. But in the way we convert it into a formula, the things become more clear though the letters are not good to remember. How can we master this proof completely? Although in answering the first question, we have just concluded that images do not generalize propositions, yet images are a great memory aid here. We can simplify the complete figure, and only memorize the most central part, i.e. the two sides plus the small tail next to it. After that, think about the two sides being the radius of a certain circle(blue), the small tail and a part of a certain side also being the radius of another circle(green), the remaining part of this side and a part of another side being equilateral(orange), so the remaining side of another side is equal to the small tail. Thus the entire reasoning of the proposition can be recalled by the color line segment. Any geometry problem must have its core points and lines, and key auxiliary lines, and the most important part of learning geometry is to grasp the key points and the structure. Once you can grasp the structure of the proof through images, then the whole problem will be solved easily.

"],["discussion-iii-prop3.html", "Chapter 3 Discussion III (Prop3)", " Chapter 3 Discussion III (Prop3) Given two unequal straight lines, to cut off from the greater a straight line equal to the less. Today we will look at Proposition 3, which is very short, and yet today we are discussing how to understand its simplicity, and firstly, we check a programming example of ft_split. (Background knowledge: ft is short for function, ft_split means the function to split strings of characters, in other words, it is a programming function to split letters of words. I wrote it in 2019 for an exam. ) This example is written in the programming language C. Of course, the focus of this lesson will not be on understanding the content of this code, but on its analogy of format with Euclid’s Proposition 3. Let’s take a look at it. First of all, the first line has an include stdlib, which means that in the following code a function (malloc) will be called from the library stdlib. If there is no header in the first line, then when the line of code malloc in ft_malloc is running, an error should be reported and it is not possible to proceed, because none of the functions related to malloc can be called. Does this make you think about something similar in Euclid’s Elements? Yes, libraries correspond to the set of definitions, postulates and common notions in Euclid’s mathematical system, except that there are a large number of definitions in C. The definitions are grouped according to their functionality, and they are called only when needed. After the headline, there are four separate “loops”, easy to separate them by a line following {}.In this project, the first three loops are small loops, and the last one, **char ft_split(){}, is the main loop. Now we look at the code and I tell you that the order cannot be changed. Because you can find that ft_index(){} references ft_definesep(){}, then *ft_malloc(){} references ft_definesep(){}, and the last **ft_split{}() references all first three ones. If you switch any one of the functions to mix the order, the code will report an error. This is because the computer reads the code linearly, and if it runs to an “ft” that has not been defined before, the computer will report an error since it cannot understand what it is trying to do. The same is true for Euclid. Proposition 3 is short because proposition 1 and 2 are pre-populated. Proposition I, II, and III are placed on the same page and headed with a statement containing the defining postulate and common notion, so that Proposition III becomes fully operational. If propositions I and II are not deliberately listed separately, then they should be inserted into proposition III, like the following. Here comes an interesting discussion, under what circumstances a module has to be put separated? It challenges us both in the following two different situations: In Euclid’s proof, why should Proposition I and Proposition II stand out separately? Even writing them into Proposition III does not lead to excessive length. In our code, why can’t we write all the small loops into the big loop and call them separately when we use them? Because there are a group of certain lines of code that are too commonly used, instead of writing them repeatedly each time, it is better to list them separately in advance and call them with a single command while in demand. For Alex, who has experience with C++, it is not very difficult to understand this, but I imagine that it could take time for kids who have no experience of coding. It shares the same principle in Euclid’s geometric proofs. If we know that a certain part will be used frequently, then we need this part to be written out as a prior proposition for subsequent use. Euclid’s Elements can even be considered as a complete collection of the original programming code. Thinking about writing thousands of lines of code manually and calling each proposition from memory, doesn’t it make you understand more about the transcendence of this book for its century? Next time, we will discuss Proposition 4, and there is an important difference between Propositions 1 to 3 and Proposition 4. The first three propositions are actually “drawing”, drawing a triangle, drawing a line segment, intercepting a line segment. The aim is to construct. But Proposition 4 is a proof without construction. In the next lesson we’ll look at the key role of logical reasoning.

Examples: Prepare the clothes of a week, to save time in the morning for selection, buy milk for a week instead of passing the grocery store every day. ) "],["discussion-iv-prop4.html", "Chapter 4 Discussion IV (Prop4)", " Chapter 4 Discussion IV (Prop4) If two triangles have the two sides equal to two sides respectively, and have the angles contained by the equal straight lines equal, they will also have the base equal to the base, the triangle will be equal to the triangle, and the remaining angles will be equal to the remaining angles respectively, namely those which the equal sides subtend. Today we look at a very disputable proposition together. In the beginning of the class, Alex claims that this proposition is about congruent triangles, which he has already learned in his school math class. Alex proves in this way: because the two sides and the angles are equal, the two triangles are congruent. Then our question arises: Have you ever wondered why two triangles are congruent because two sides are equal and the angles are equal? This is one method of determining congruent triangles, yes, but how did it become a method of determination in the first place? Now we are exploring why the math textbook declares so. Math textbooks are written this way because Euclid said so and following mathematicians all agreed, but why did Euclid make this claim and how did he make it? By the same token, we can’t just believe what Euclid said simply because he is Euclid, we can’t just think it’s right because Euclid sait it. We have to look over this proof carefully as well. The special thing about Proposition 4 is that many people read this proof of the congruent triangle and think that there is something wrong with Euclid’s argument. Alex himself, after reading the proof, asked the question that everyone would have noticed: how can Euclid put one point on top of another, and how can he ensure that the two points coincide and are equal. In the previous Common Notions, Euclid wrote Common Notion 4: Things which coincide with one another are equal to one another. This common notion 4 is not as famous as the Postulate 5, which is about parallelism. Yet it is very significant in my eyes because this common notion is a bridge to connect the real and the geometric world. Coincidence, like overlapping, is a real-world concept that is not present in the definition; we are directly carrying a concept that is common in reality, and applying it into the geometric world, and then equating it with equality. The strangeness of Proposition 4 also stems from this, it is somewhere at a state of not true not false, depicted at the junction of reality and geometry. Alex says that if it is possible to move and overlap, then it is also possible to rotate, and in the case of rotation, since it is always the same triangle, then the old and the new must be congruent. Yes, it is possible, then in this case, the previous common notions should include overlap and it is also necessary to describe the nature of rotation. What’s more Alex mentions the use of a ruler and a protractor. However, if the rotation is still at the junction of those two worlds that are not true not false, then taking a ruler and a protractor is standing fully in the real world and thus it’s not the same. It’s also worthy to note the logical progression of this proof. The proof itself is divided into two parts: the side by side proof of congruence; and the congruence proof of equality of the remaining sides and angles. The second part is often ignored because people subconsciously believe that two triangles are congruent, then the remaining sides and angles are equal, but in fact there is a step in between. That is, because the triangles are congruent, the remaining sides and angles are also congruent, so they are equal. This equality is not directly derived from the congruence of the triangles, but also uses the concept of the coincidence in Common notions 4. In addition, this proof is only about the congruence of the “side-angle-side”, and does not involve the rest of the proof of congruence, such as the “side-side-angle”or “side-side-side”. Thus pay attention that the rest of the methods still need to be proved before being used. At this point, with Alex, we also discussed why school math classes and textbooks mainly focus on theorems and properties rather than proofs. In fact, for me it is an efficiency issue. From ancient times to the present, mathematicians have kept developing the subject and have written a great amount of books, all of which are the content of everyone’s lifetime thinking, and the development to today, while we enjoy the fruits of our predecessors’ efforts, there is also a problem that we have to understand and absorb all these contents in a very short period of time, in order to continue the development. This then requires that the learning content be refined and compressed. That is, to inform the widely accepted basic proofs as ‘definitions’. Then you don’t need to know how our predecessors proved it, but only need to use it as a ‘definition’, because others have already proven him right for you. But there is also a disadvantage that it creates an impression on everyone that things can be used directly, and things are what they are. Actually, no, these properties and theorems were also proven in the beginning. For example, that two lines are parallel and congruent angles are equal is Proposition XXVIII. I told Alex that I hope he would think more when learning mathematics, and have a skeptical attitude, even though 99.99% of what is in the textbook is correct without proof, but this skeptical attitude can keep your mind sharp, observe more, and think more often. Immediately, for proposition IV, is it always true that two congruent triangles are equal to each other? Alex soon realized that this is absolutely true, but because this is plane geometry, it looks different on a curved surface, and Alex drew this example (illustration), which is the origin of non-Euclidean geometry. He figured out this by himself and I am so proud of him. For my observation, in the argument of this lesson, Alex’s way of expression involves a very interesting issue, namely, the three incomplete expressions of mathematics: one is a literal description; the second one is symbol and letter; and the third is image. I asked Alex if he found it fun, in terms of what mathematics really is. It seems that mathematics is something that can be expressed in at least three ways. But the mathematics expressed in all three ways seems to be incomplete. We left this doubt and took our time to think about it. At the end of this lesson, Alex took the initiative to think about and propose a way to proceed in the lesson: Alex would have to prepare the proofs before the lesson, and at the beginning of each lesson, I would dictate the proposition and Alex would draw the diagram and argue the proposition himself, either on his own or using Euclid’s method. When preparing for class, always look at Euclid’s method, and if it is different from his own, think about what is different and why Euclid used it.

"],["discussion-v-prop5.html", "Chapter 5 Discussion V (Prop5)", " Chapter 5 Discussion V (Prop5) In isosceles triangles the angles at the base are equal to one another, and, if the equal straight lines be produced further, the angles under the base will be equal to one another. Today’s Proposition 5 is about isosceles triangles. Through the study of Proposition 5, we will gain a better understanding of the rigor of Euclid’s proofs. As well as reflecting on the limitations of normal mathematics study, we try to avoid the trap and think more precisely in our learning. Proposition 5 is to prove that the two base angles of an isosceles triangle are equal, and that the complementary angles of the base angles are also equal after extending both sides. Alex’s reaction to the statement of Prop 5 is very interesting. He said two base angles of the isosceles triangle are equal, and thus two straight angles (180 degrees) each minus the equal two base angles must also be equal. In this way, we can see that Alex’ attempt is to treat the proposition as a property and his declaration of equality is missing proof. Afterwards, he deduces that the complementary angles are equal. Why could this happen? Because Alex remembered that the two waists of an isosceles triangle are equal and the two base angles are also equal. This exists for him as a definition that does not require proof of truth and it is reasonably present. This is a common problem in mathematics textbooks, where propositions that need to be proved are taught as “definitions” and students rarely think about why and how this is proved. We had little conversation about this already in our last discussion. It is not difficult to inspire students to reflect on this problem, just remind them that among the known conditions, we only know that there is a triangle and that the two sides are equal, but the rest is unknown. Alex then makes a second attempt, to be summarized, he desires to prove the congruence of small triangles by using the property of “isosceles triangles three lines one theorem’’, and then to prove the equality of the base angles. Again, I reminded him that the theorem also requires a proof, which we have not arrived at yet. So we began to look at each of the three cases to derive the equality of the base angles. First we looked at the possibility of angle bisectors. If the angles can be bisected, then the two smaller triangles cut by the angle bisectors of the isosceles triangle can be determined to be congruent by SAS (Side Angle Side), and then it is natural that the two base angles, as corresponding parts of congruent triangles, are also equal. But here is a problem: How do we know that the line drawn can bisect the top angle? In the course of Alex’s proof, I have to ask repeatedly why the line divides the angle into two halves. I agree that the line drawn divides the angle into two parts, but how can he convince me that the two parts are equal? He needs to prove it before the application. In other words, I tell him that he can use the method of bisecting an angle, but he also needs to prove that the line drawn has the function of bisecting the angle first. Let’s look at the angle bisector example together. After the forward-back exchange, Alex and me agree that if we want to use angle bisectors, we need to prove triangles congruent by method SSS (Side Side Side), and SSS proof of congruence is not a proven proposition at this step, although in the study of Proposition 4 we have had the most preliminary knowledge of congruent triangles, but we only know two things: The equality of SAS (Side Angle Side) can prove that two triangles are congruent; Congruent triangles have three corresponding equal sides and angles. From the above two properties, it is not possible to deduce directly that the SSS leads to congruent triangles, and therefore Alex cannot proceed with the method of making angle bisectors. In fact, whether it is the first attempt or the angle bisector solution here, the same problem is behind it, that is, Alex applies what they learned in school math class directly without thinking about the logic, reasoning and the proof behind it. Whatever is taught by the teacher and learned in class is taken for granted. Thus, the most important thing to learn in this lesson is not Euclid’s method of proof, but to change the previous reaction format, to form new habits, to take a few more steps back to ask and verify why. Afterwards, Alex also tried other methods. He is a very courageous and curious student that is willing to develop his own methods. I am also happy to accompany him for different attempts because I believe that students learn more deeply by their own experience instead of being taught. Thus, we spend time trying the method of drawing the median and the height(perpendicular). Drawing the median seems simple enough, taking the midpoint on the bottom side and connecting the vertices, but doesn’t it also require proving that the point taken exactly divides the bottom edge into two equal parts? As for the height, we will find that SSA (Side Side Angle) cannot guarantee congruent triangles. Together with Alex, we look at a set of counterexamples where the side angles are equal but the triangles are not congruent. At this point, after trying out all kinds of ideas of his own, Alex is more patient and also more respected to the subtlety of the method chosen by Euclid. Therefore, it is worthwhile to try to solve the problem on a student’s own in the process of learning. In addition to reasoning, there is a shortcut to understand this problem. Although it is not a rigorous proof, it can give us confidence and allow us to persist in our search for this property. As an example, the simplest thing is to have a paper isosceles triangle, we fold it in half, and then we find that the two parts overlap exactly, so the bottom angles are naturally equal. Alex came up with the idea of having a right triangle, fixing one of its sides, and then rotating it 180 degrees, so that the original triangle and the new triangle form a large triangle that is isosceles, and the base angles must also be equal. This is how reasoning and practice overlap and differ from each other. Mathematics itself is a kind of connection, it accomplishes the present while preparing for future inferences, always in a position to carry forward and backward, while life often does not need explanation, does not need rigor logic, what the eyes see, what the ears hear can be taken as truth. After reading Proposition 5 again, we skimmed through Proposition 9 together, because Alex wants to know how Euclid draws the angle bisector. And we find that this uses the step of proving congruence by the equality of the three sides. (SSS) This is the content of Proposition VIII, (again, Proposition IV only proves SAS congruence.) Proposition VIII builds on VII and so on, and so forth, with each of the initial proof questions being closely related to the later developments. Suddenly here, through a barking moment, Alex understands that the properties of congruent triangles require proof and are not taken for granted.

Today we plan to study Proposition 6 and 7 and we will encounter Reductio. Proposition 6 is about proving that equal angles lead to equal sides in a triangle. It uses the reductio ad absurdum method, that is, the converse way of proof, which proves that equal angles must lead to corresponding equal sides by denying the other possibility that equal angles could have unequal corresponding sides. The previous proofs were all forward-order proofs. It’s like a material and a model. The previous proofs are to build up the final model from the material little by little, while this proof is to dismantle the model and see if we could dismantle the material differently than expected. What is more interesting here is that we reflect on our own acceptance and discuss whether the two approaches are equally convincing. For Alex, either the forward or reverse proof is acceptable as long as the logic is unquestionable. For me, I might subconsciously wonder why I can’t prove it forward firstly, is it only provable in reverse? I invite Alex to try to prove the problem without reductio ad absurdum, but in normal order. We drew the diagram and reflected together, but we could not find a completely suitable idea. Alex proposes to use a special method, that is to set an isosceles triangle as a right angle isosceles triangle, and then by calculating sin45 degrees to show that the two sides are equal. Although this method is very advanced here, it shows how Alex has applied what he learned in school. The fact that we didn’t find the right geometric idea doesn’t mean that this problem can’t be proved without reductio, but at least our attempts indicated the difficulty, and it seems that the reductio ad absurdum is easier to be applied here. So if we must use the converse way, what should we pay attention to? Probably like the name says, the reductio ad absurdum, while reducing the statement, we need to check all cases and negate all other possibilities to identify the desired unique solution. 6.2 Proposition 7 Given two straight lines constructed on a straight line [from its extremities] and meeting in a point, there cannot be constructed on the same straight line [from its extremities], and on the same side of it, two other straight lines meeting in another point and equal to the former two respectively, namely each to that which has the same extremity with it. The statement of Proposition 7 is a bit convoluted, but to explain it in a simpler way, it says that if you find an arbitrary point on one side of a line segment, you cannot find a second point that makes the new line segment equal in length after joining the two endpoints of the segment. The method here is still reductio ad absurdum, the proposition is not difficult to understand, and Alex and I quickly review Euclid’s proof together. It is worth noting here that Alex proposes his own reductio ad absurdum method, which uses motion trajectories and drawing circles to illustrate, as follows. Draw a circle with A as the center and AC as the distance; draw a circle with B as the center and BC as the radius. If the BC distance is constant, point C must move on the arc, and the distance between any other point and A must change, either larger or smaller, because circle A and circle B have only one intersection point on the same side of AB. Similarly, if the distance of AC is constant, the distance of BC changes. Therefore, no second point can be found on the same side of AB to keep AC,BC constant. Alex’s method of proof is to solve the problem from the point of view of motion, which is very open-minded. At the same time, Alex also mentions when proving this proof that if a second point can be found so that the connected line segments are equal, then it is on a three-dimensional space, not on a plane. In other words, Alex has noticed the unspoken precondition for these propositions, “plane” geometry. Learning this proposition, it is easy to question why we need this proposition and it seems that we cannot see a clear objective. Recalling our memory of the programming case of Discussion III, it is not difficult to surmise that Euclid is setting the stage for following propositions. It is just not clear what the proof is being prepared for. This is actually true in life as well, where some things may seem to be meaningless in the moment, but are actually part of life afterwards. By studying these propositions, it helps us understand at least two things: one is dismantling; and the other is preparing. Breaking down large tasks to a level that can be accomplished, some preparation tasks may not make sense in the present moment.

"],["discussion-vii-prop-8-11.html", "Chapter 7 Discussion VII (Prop 8-11) 7.1 Proposition 8 7.2 Proposition 10 7.3 Proposition 11", " Chapter 7 Discussion VII (Prop 8-11) As Alex becomes familiar with Euclid’s proof, and because of the repetitive nature of the proof form, we will pick up the pace slightly in terms of content. In this class, we discussed proposition 8 to 10 and skim proposition 11. 7.1 Proposition 8 If two triangles have the two sides equal to two sides respectively, and have also the base equal to the base, they will also have the angles equal which are contained by the equal straight lines. Alex first tries to prove it himself. In his first attempt, Alex chooses isosceles triangles, and here there’s a misunderstanding in the meaning of the question, and he does not read the question carefully enough. The two corresponding sides of the two triangles equal to each other, it does not specify isosceles triangles, but rather that there are two triangles whose sides correspond to each other equally, and what Euclid is trying to prove is a general theorem. (green: special case of isosceles triangles; purple, general generic case, which can be acute/obtuse/right/isosceles/equilateral triangles, etc.) Since Proposition 7 becomes a part of this proposition and plays a key role in the reasoning, Alex also claims that he now understands the purpose of Proposition 7 better, as a necessary component of Proposition 8. This was expected by yesterday. ##Proposition 9 &gt;To bisect a given rectilineal angle. The next proposition is about drawing the angle bisector, which we have skimmed in earlier classes. Today I ask Alex to prove carefully again, and we will find that the logical framework of this question is as follows: isosceles triangle, equilateral triangle, congruent triangle =&gt; angle bisector. Thus, this proposition requires 3 layers of preparation. The two waists of the isosceles triangle are equal, the two sides of the equilateral triangle and the connected common side together to meet the condition of SSS method to prove congruent triangles. This short and simple proposition actually shows us the skill of doing auxiliary lines. Auxiliary lines are the key to solving mathematical geometry problems, and if you draw the right auxiliary lines, the geometry proof will be easy to write. Sometimes it seems like it takes more than one attempt to find the right one, but if you understand the purpose of the auxiliary line, you can apply a reverse-order reasoning method to find the correct one. For example, in the example of Proposition 9, the ultimate purpose of the question is to divide an arbitrary angle equally. It is natural to think that the two angles being equally divided are each part of a certain triangle, and by congruence it can be inferred that the corresponding two angles are equal. In order to construct congruent triangles, then, in addition to the common side of the bisector, equilateral and isosceles triangles are needed to construct the known condition that the corresponding sides are equal. In this way, the auxiliary lines must be associated with equilateral and isosceles triangles, and we need to draw equilateral and isosceles triangles with the auxiliary lines. When you are lost to find the auxiliary lines in a math problem, you may want to work backwards from the conclusion to see what additional images are needed, those additional theorems and properties to aid in the proof, and so the auxiliary lines are found. This question discusses the concept of bisection, and we can go back to Definition XVII to see what happens there. Definition XVII: A diameter of the circle is any straight line drawn through the centre and terminated in both directions by the circumference of the circle, and such a straight line also bisects the circle. Definition XVII says that the diameter divides the circle into two. Is the diameter equally divided? Why didn’t Euclid prove it? Yes, he says that the circle is divided into two, and this implies an equal division. I ask Alex to think about why a proof is not needed for the equal division of a circle, and Alex says that the diameter draws two linear angles, both 180 degrees, so the two parts are the same. So how do you prove that the two arcs are the same? The default here is equal angles to equal arcs. Then why do we need to prove equal angles to equal sides in isosceles triangles? Alex’s cyclotomic method 7.2 Proposition 10 To bisect a given finite straight line. Then we briefly go over Proposition 10, which is a continuation of Proposition 9. It is not difficult because it applied the same method as Proposition 9, to deduce the bisector of a line backwards through congruent triangles. In addition, this is part of the “isosceles triangles three lines one theorem”, where the angle bisector and median coincide. 7.3 Proposition 11 To draw a straight line at right angles to a given straight line from a given point on it. In fact, doing demonstrations in class can also reveal the child’s personality, like Alex, the more difficult and challenging the topic is, the more motivated he feels. Simple problems are more likely to be passed by. For example, Proposition 11, Alex draws the vertical line directly, which was also influenced by his school math class, but we hadn’t actually proven how to draw a vertical line. Proposition 11 is a continuation of the above two questions about the “isosceles triangles three lines one theorem”. Here, we follow up the previous question with the median, and then prove that in an equilateral triangle, it is also the perpendicular that can be drawn. Therefore, the order here is: Angle Bisector =&gt; Median =&gt; Perpendicular line. For geometry problems in mathematics, it is true that the idea is very important, with the idea, basically a problem is solved, but the expression is also as important, because even if the thing is 100% done, the final expression is presented by 50% only, then we may only recognize 50% of it and the skipped part would not be recognized. At the beginning of the next lesson, we should go over this proof again, without skipping steps, and following the format. The aim is to review the thought structure as a whole and take a close look on Euclid’s expression.

In our last discussion, we went through Proposition 11 very quickly. Now we slow down to review it and take time to focus on the format of writing: Proposition number: Proposition XI The abstract and general proposition heading: To draw a straight line at right angles to a given straight line from a given point on it. Translate the propositional content into concrete images and letter symbols, i.e., translate the proposition into what the proof will present next. Let AB be the given straight line, and C the given point on it. Thus it is required to draw from the point C a straight line at right angles to the straight line AB. Graphing and making conclusions on specific images and symbols. Let a point D be taken at random on AC; let CE be made equal to CD; [I. 3] on DE let the equilateral triangle FDE be constructed, and let FC be joined; [I. 1] I say that the straight line FC has been drawn at right angles to the given straight line AB from C the given point on it. Details of the proof: For, since DC is equal to CE, and CF is common, the two sides DC, CF are equal to the two sides EC, CF respectively; and the base DF is equal to the base FE; therefore the angle DCF is equal to the angle ECF; [I. 8] and they are adjacent angles. But, when a straight line set up on a straight line makes the adjacent angles equal to one another, each of the equal angles is right; [Def. 10] therefore each of the angles DCF, FCE is right. Statement of completion proof: Therefore the straight line CF has been drawn at right angles to the given straight line AB from the given point C on it. Q.E.F. You will notice that Euclid did not draw the diagram while writing the proof, but first drew the diagram and then proved it, separately. What does this mean? It means that the proofs in the book Elements are not a simple demonstration of the proof process, but a summary and reorganization after the proof. It is like we need a draft to write a proof and a final version on the exam paper, the proof in Elements that we see is just a final version. So sometimes we say that Euclid is very thoughtful and his reasoning is flowing. But it may not be done from the very beginning, instead, it may be gradually added and perfected. The developed format that he displays his proof is worthy learning. First of all, each proposition has a serial number that simply represents it, followed by a concise summary. After the proof begins, the abstract content, which is not easy to understand, is first visualized by the image, text, symbols. Then the steps for constructing the diagram are described, followed by a return to the original point on the complete image to begin the proof. After the proof is complete there is a statement to mark its completion. You see that it is formatted with a beginning and an end, very clearly. This approach is particularly suitable for writing to communicate with people, even if it is not a proof but a lab report, you can present your work in this format, and if it is a report, it would look like the following: Title, date (author) Overview of the report (further explanation of the title, including concepts, methodology, etc.) Putting conceptual issues into practice, describing the relevant experimental equipment, background, and linking the experiment to the topic of the report Important experimental steps and results Specific experimental procedures Final return of the experiment to the topic of the report This format takes full account of the reader’s receptiveness, from the topic, to the overview, to the figurative problem, to the steps and summary of the solution. This strategy of format construction can be applied on different report-based document writing, which does not necessarily present a thought process, yet is reader-friendly, very systematic, and highly readable. In contrast to this is the prose type of writing, or the exploration from a problem, often it presents the author’s thought process, but it is also easy to take the reader off the road and miss the important discoveries. When writing, it is important to choose the appropriate approach with reference to the object and purpose of the writing. Disciplines such as math or science are written with a generalized purpose, hence a clear format and structure is particularly important. In the case of literature, the focus is more on the description of individual experiences, empathizing with the reader in detail, and the reader receives not the same environment but the emotions, thoughts, and the conveyed individual reactions. 8.2 Proposition 12 To a given infinite straight line, from a given point which is not on it, to draw a perpendicular straight line. After the extensive discussion of format, we move forward to Proposition 12 and 13. Proposition 12 is closely related to proposition 11 and looks somewhat similar, thus also making us wonder why these two cannot be combined in the same proposition. At first, you may wonder about the progression of right angles and perpendicular lines, but then I realized that it is better to look at it in another way: if you read carefully the expressions of the two proofs, you will see that there is still a slight difference in the conditions. Proposition 11, it’s still a point on the line, and Proposition 12, it extends the scope to a point outside the line. In other words, Proposition 11 is still within the study of the “three lines one theorem”, which requires the application of equilateral triangles, while the perpendicular line in Proposition 12 walks out the top/bottom angle of the triangle. It can be any point outside the line in relation to the line. 8.3 Proposition 13 If a straight line set up on a straight line make angles, it will make either two right angles or angles equal to two right angles. For Proposition 13, Alex encounters a big confusion: whether a line intersects another line at an angle or not, it should be 180 degrees itself, this is equal to two right angles, thus why we still need this proposition. To understand this proposition, Alex’s confusion needs to be broken down into two parts. The first part is whether we describe the straight line in terms of two right angles or 180 degrees. In fact, the aim of our expression is that the sum of the angles made by one line and the other line is constant. It seems that this truth is self-evident from the image. It is correct to say so, and in this proposition we need a metric to describe this fixed quantity. This proposition is not just about proving that there is an equivalent quantity here, but also about expressing that equivalent quantity in the proper way, which is what the second part needs to explain: why it is expressed in terms of two right angles and not 180 degrees. One of the major obstacles to Alex’s learning from the beginning of this course was the obsession with numbers. What is the difference between the concepts of ‘two right angles’ and ‘180 degrees’? In Alex’s eyes, ‘two right angles’ and ‘180 degrees’ both refer to the same image, and in that sense, they do, being the sum of the angels mentioned in the first part, which are equal. However, the difference between these two concepts lies in the fact that their units of measurement are not the same. ‘Two right angles’ is a right angle * 2, while ‘180 degrees’ is 1 degree * 180. we have the concept of right angle in the definition, but without a protractor, there is no 1 degree and no 180 degrees. That is to say, ‘180 degrees’ misses a cognitive base for application, i.e., a standard unit of measure. For example, I can say that the same image is a flat angle, but we do not define a flat angle, so there is a possibility of misunderstanding, and to avoid ambiguity, we do not use undefined units and terms. Then, if our current units are only right angles and no degrees exist, we need to compare all new ‘angles’ with a right angle. For these two reasons, propositions have to be declared explicitly. Another point to note is the strategy of this proposition, which is to draw a right angle with an auxiliary line. Since the unit of measure is a right angle, and the final expression of the quantity is two right angles, it is natural that the auxiliary line needs to create a right angle as a medium for comparison and measurement.We can use the same tech, to identify the purpose and aim of proposition and then find the auxiliary line.

Proposition 14 is a reversal of Proposition 13. Proposition 13 says that the angle between a line and another line must be equal to two right angles. Proposition XIV reverses it and says that if the angle between two lines and the middle line is equal to two right angles, then both lines are on the same line. Of course, it’s our tradition to discuss the necessity of this separation. Why are two propositions proved separately and why are they both needed? To understand the relationship between these two propositions, we have to introduce a piece of knowledge that Alex has not yet learned: the determination of necessary and sufficient conditions. Let’s take a few simple examples to understand the concepts of Necessity and Sufficiency: Sufficient but not necessary conditions It’s raining today and the air humidity is high. Because of the rain, the humidity in the air is high. But high air humidity is not necessarily due to rain. Heavy watering and irrigation, or early mornings when it is not raining but foggy, can all lead to high air humidity. So rain is only one of the many possible causes of high air humidity, which we call a sufficient but not necessary condition. Necessary but not sufficient conditions The phone is charged so that Alex can play with it. If the phone has electricity, Alex can play with the phone. If the phone has no electricity, Alex cannot play with the phone. The phone has electricity as a necessary condition for playing with the phone. But when the phone has power, Alex may not be playing with the phone, he may be using it to make phone calls, so it is a necessary but not sufficient condition. Sufficient and Necessary Condition (Sufficient Condition) Alex got a perfect score on the test. Alex got every question right. In fact, a sufficient necessary condition is to change the same meaning into two ways to say it. The definitions in Elements are often of this type, for example: a triangle is an equilateral triangle and the three sides of the triangle are equal. The three sides of an equilateral triangle must be equal, and a triangle with three equal sides must be an equilateral triangle. This can be inferred from each other as a sufficient and necessary condition for each other. Not necessary and not sufficient conditions It was a beautiful day and Alex ate candy. Yesterday the weather was fine, but Alex did not eat a candy; Alex ate a candy the day before, but the weather was bad. This shows that good weather and eating candy are not directly related, but are contingent events, so they are unnecessary and insufficient conditions for each other. After understanding these four conditions, let’s look at proposition 13 and 14 again. Now we understand that Proposition 13 can only say that the proof deduces a conclusion from a condition, and does not tacitly assume that the condition can be deduced inversely from the conclusion. Through Proposition 14, which reverses the condition and the conclusion, we know that the angle between two right angles and a straight line are sufficient and necessary conditions for each other. Because the statement of Proposition 14 is not in the definition, nor in Postulates, nor in Common Notions, so the proof is needed. Let’s review again the proposition 13 and 14 with a closer look of the involved definitions and postulates: Definition 8: A plane angle is the inclination to one another of two lines in a plane which meet one another and do not lie in a straight line. Definition 9: And when the lines containing the angle are straight, the angle is called rectilineal. Definition 10: When a straight line set up on a straight line makes the adjacent angles equal to one another, each of the equal angles is right, and the straight line standing on the other is called a perpendicular to that on which it stands. Postulate 4: That all right angles are equal to one another. Definition 9 is the definition of a right angle, and its usefulness is not obvious here, but if one says that a circle is tangent to a line, this definition avoids the complication here, namely the problem of discussing the magnitude of the angle between an arc and a line. It is worth noting that right angles are defined here not by their magnitude but by the description of a specific phenomenon. In other words, even if we have an angle that is exactly equal in size to a “right angle”, we cannot say that it is a “right angle” directly by definition, because the definition of a right angle here requires two lines and two adjacent angles. Only in this case that a right angle is a right angle. Therefore, in Proposition 14, we need to make an auxiliary line to retrace the image to apply the concept of a right angle. It is also by the derivation of Proposition 14 that “right angles” are no longer restricted to the equality of the angle between two adjacent lines, but can be used outside of this specific situation, and “two right angles” is thus transformed into a quantity that is measured by the unit right angle, even as a new unit itself. Instead of constructing a right angle, a straight line can be drawn to directly declare the being of two right angles. Postulate 4, That all right angles are equal to one another. It seems strange because since right angles are defined, shouldn’t all angles be equal to each other as a matter of fact, if all they are right angles? In that case, it should be a common notion rather than a postulate. We might easily have thought that Euclid had taken into account the case of curved surfaces, but I think it is not right to interpret it that way, because after all, no other definition or proposition could be seen to mention the consideration of curved surfaces. After reconnecting Definition 10 and Postulate 4, I realized that it was like this: the right angle in Definition 10 is a phenomenon, while Postulate 4 is a transformation from a phenomenon to a unit of measure. We begged for this transformation process to be free of error. Postulate 4, Definition 10 and Proposition 14 together extend the concept and application of right angles. Also for this proposition, Alex observes that it is important to restrict the scope to the plane. On a curved surface there would be no guarantee that two straight lines are on the same line. 9.2 Proposition 15 If two straight lines cut one another, they make the vertical angles equal to one another. Proposition 15 is very short and simple, but I was surprised by Alex. It seems that we reach a moment where he doesn’t ask why an obvious statement needs a proof. The effect of this discussion class seems to start to work. Thus, I throw back the question to Alex, why do we need to prove this? Alex has grown accustomed to proving propositions that seem self-explanatory, and in his words, anything that is not in the definition/postulate/common notion needs to be proved. Then why not write it into the definition/postulate/common notion? Because we only save the most basic and necessary principles in the primary library. All that can be deducted is excluded in the library. Alex seems to have gotten better at understanding the rigor of logic. 9.3 Proposition 16 In any triangle, if one of the sides be produced, the exterior angle is greater than either of the interior and opposite angles. However, immediately following Proposition 16, Alex again thinks, if the exterior angle is equal to the sum of the other two interior angles, then it must be greater than either of the interior angles. He mixes his advanced math with Euclid’s proof again. We always choose to prove instead of arguing, i.e., let Alex prove that the exterior angle is equal to the sum of the two interior angles. Alex tries, but finds that none of the required theorems are proved, such as parallel congruent angles and equality of interior angles. We end up going back to Euclid to see how he proved it. Although all of our attempts failed, it is meaningful because it helped Alex understand the validity of the proposition here and the cleverness of Euclid’s method of proof.

"],["discussion-x-prop-17-20.html", "Chapter 10 Discussion X (Prop 17-20) 10.1 Proposition 17 10.2 Proposition 18 &amp; 19 10.3 Proposition 20", " Chapter 10 Discussion X (Prop 17-20) Today we discuss propositions 17,18, 19 and 20. 10.1 Proposition 17 In any triangle two angles taken together in any manner are less than two right angles. For Proposition 17, Alex presents his idea: If there are two right angles, then the two lines are parallel and will not intersect, and they cannot form a triangle either. Thus, any two angles in a triangle must be less than two right angles. As written in Postulate 5, where the sum of two interior angles is less than two right angles, they must necessarily intersect on the same side. Naturally, if they necessarily intersect, then there must be a triangle. For Postulate 5, if two angles are greater than two right angles, then the other side is less than two right angles, which means that the other side will intersect. But it ignores the case where the interior angle is equal to two right angles. If we look at definition23: Parallel straight lines are straight lines which, being in the same plane and being produced indefinitely in both directions, do not meet one another in either direction. In this definition, there is no mention of the special properties when intersecting a third line perpendicularly and thus, we still need to prove it. Here the question becomes: can we derive Proposition 17 directly by applying Definition 23 and Postulate 5? This question is not easy to answer. If we look at this logic chain, we find that the most difficult step is still the first step: two right angles =&gt; parallel lines =&gt; No intersection (Definition 23: the property of parallelism) =&gt; cannot construct a triangle (Definition 19, which requires three sides to form a triangle). The key then is whether right angles =&gt; parallel lines can be introduced through the Postulate 5. Can we introduce two right angles =&gt; not intersecting on either side =&gt; parallel? The key here is the “two right angles =&gt; no interaction” step. This is the logical p-&gt;q, whether we can get ﹁p→﹁q (﹁ means negation), that is, whether “not two right angles =&gt; intersect” is equivalent to “two right angles =&gt; do not intersect”. But logically, p→q ≡ ﹁q →﹁p, i.e., the equivalence of “not two right angles =&gt; intersect” is “no intersection =&gt; two right angles”, which is different from “two right angles =&gt; no intersection”. Here I introduce to Alex the additional logical relations among p-&gt;q; ﹁p→ ﹁q; ﹁p→﹁q: p-&gt;q, which shows that p is a sufficient condition for q. That is, it is raining today and the air humidity is high. We do not conclude that it is not raining today, then the air humidity is low, because in fog, snow, etc. can lead to high air humidity. But we can say that the air humidity is low and it is not raining today. High air humidity is not necessarily caused by rain, but low air humidity must not have rained. Thus under the condition that Postulate 5 holds, we can’t say “two right angles =&gt; parallel”, but we can say “parallel (not intersect) =&gt; interior angle and two right angles (not less than two right angles)”. In fact, we just need to switch the conditions and conclusions of Postulate 5, which is Proposition 17. Postulate 5: That, if a straight line falling on two straight lines make the interior angles on the same side less than two right angles, the two straight lines, if produced indefinitely, meet on that side on which are the angles less than the two right angles. Counterpoint: If two lines extend infinitely to intersect on one side, then the sum of the interior angles resulting from the intersection with the third line is less than two right angles. Proposition 17: In any triangle two angles taken together in any manner are less than two right angles. The only slight difference, if any, is that the two lines intersect and also make up the triangle with the third line. So Postulate 5 and proposition 17, when put together, seem to be statements of mutual sufficient and necessary conditions, except that one has no way to prove it, in the form of Postulate, while the other, at a later position, is already provable. I think the reason for not stating Proposition 17 as a Postulate here is also to reduce the postulate as much as possible. After all, as we explained in the set of Propositions 13 and 14: the mutual sufficient and necessary condition is also proved rather than tacitly assumed to exist. For proofs, we try to use as few controversial postulates as possible to enhance persuasiveness. 10.2 Proposition 18 &amp; 19 Proposition 18: In any triangle the greater side subtends the greater angle. Proposition 19: In any triangle the greater angle is subtended by the greater side. Let’s see another example of the pair Proposition 18 and 19. They are again a set of sufficient and necessary conditions for proving each other. In terms of the manner of argument, Proposition 18 is a positive proof based on the previous proposition. As for Proposition 19, we can take a closer look at its logic. Proposition 18 says that the long side -&gt; the large angle. That is, short side -&gt; small angle. It is worth noting that “long side -&gt; large angle” and “short side -&gt; small angle” are tautologies. It may seem at first glance that ﹁Long side → ﹁Large angle is equivalent to Short side -&gt; Small Angle, but it is not. There is a misunderstanding here, because the conditions omitted from Proposition 18 are: equality and inequality. Condition is in fact - in an arbitrary triangle, if any two sides are unequal, then the conclusion is that the longer side is corresponding to a larger angle. Thus the short side to the small angle and the long side to the large angle are both conclusions and they are tautological, not antithetical negation. Thus Euclid used Proposition 18 to prove Proposition19 with the statement that the short side -&gt; small angle, i.e., the tautological repetition of the original proposition: Original: Neither is AC less than AB, for then the angle ABC would also have been less than the angle ACB; [I.18] but it is not, therefore AC is not less than AB. Interpretation: AC must be greater than AB because if AC is less than AB, then angle BCA is smaller than angle ABC. But now angle BCA is larger than angle ABC, so AC is greater than AB. While doing this practice, Alex suggests that because a straight line is the shortest between two points, the sum of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the bottom side of the line connected between the same two points. The problem, however, is that the theorem of the shortest straight line between two points is itself an extension of Proposition 20, and there is no such definition, postulate or common notions. We only say that there must be (at least) a straight line lying between two points, but we never say that this distance is the shortest in all cases. Proposition 20 is actually a side note to explain this problem, it has compared the case of one straight line and two straight lines. So Proposition 20 cannot be proved in reverse by using the shortest between two points as a straight line, because it requires a supplementary proof, such as a comparison of curves and straight lines, polylines and straight lines, and so on. Thus we need to pay attention to the distinction between perceived or intuitive phenomena and the proved ones. 10.3 Proposition 20 In any triangle two sides taken together in any manner are greater than the remaining one. In this propositions, we find that Euclid often uses triangles and line segments as a medium to transform and fill in the quantities which need to be compared and proved, and then applies the previous propositions to complete the proof. This method is common and applicable in middle school geometry: creating equal angles, equal triangles, common sides, equal line segments, etc. to aid in the proof. If there are questions that you do not know how to solve, you can start by trying to add auxiliary lines in order to construct equal angles, equal sides, and equal triangles.

There are different ways to learn Euclid’s proofs and the two most commons are: one is to read along with Euclid’s ideas, preferably closing the book and deducing them for yourself afterwards, while the other way is to just read the statement, refer to the picture as needed, and then figure out how to deduce it for yourself to see if there is a known way to launch the conclusion. Today’s class is a challenge, partly because we try to discuss things in English(usually in Mandarin). Alex is making progress but still his speech is limited. Then we also choose the second method, hoping to think by ourselves to launch Euclid’s proof. By proofing, I hope Alex will understand the difference between creating and following, and also the help (auxiliary lines) we can find in creation. If we read Element, we always feel that the propositions are not difficult and the logic is very smooth, however, only when we try to prove it ourselves, we realize that the smoothness of the logic does not mean that the clues are obvious. Information is like pieces, even if we are sure that we can finally assemble it into a beautiful collage, the outline and lines of the college are not so easy to determine. Alex and I spent an hour of class today working on just this one proposition. There are two keys in this proposition: one is the auxiliary line, and the other is to specify the theorem to be invoked. Let’s look at the problem first: ” If on one of the sides of a triangle, from its extremities, there be constructed two straight lines meeting within the triangle, the straight lines so constructed will be less than the remaining two sides of the triangle, but will contain a greater angle.” Here you need to compare two different sets of objectives, one set is the sum of two sides and the other set is two angles. Different theorems are called to compare sides and angles, respectively, and the first twenty propositions do not have many theorems for comparing sides and angles, especially since the last proposition-Proposition 20-talking about the sum of two sides of a triangle being greater than the third side, is very likely to be used here. The previous proposition, about the size of the angles, there are comparisons of the opposite angle, the exterior angle, and the interior angle of the triangle. The proposition about the right angle can be put aside for now, because once it is a right angle, the triangle is restricted, and the statement of this proposition is obviously for triangles in general. Setting aside the propositions that can be chosen, the next question is that of auxiliary lines. We have been emphasizing the skill of choosing auxiliary lines, and the central point is to understand the role of auxiliary lines. The auxiliary line, as the name suggests, helps to complete the proposition, and this help is a kind of bridge, in other words, the auxiliary line is a medium that helps us to move from the known to the required proof. If we don’t find the bridge from the known to the required quickly, we can start with different attempts, that is, as Alex and I said, just draw, draw all the possible auxiliary lines you can think of, and then we will compare and analyze their usefulness in this proof. Alex made the following diagram: (red is the auxiliary line) Because, at the end, the auxiliary line must act as a medium, and medium means transition, because most of the auxiliary lines complement the original image as much as possible, rather than making major updates, in other words, the auxiliary lines tend to expand to a limited extent. The idea of Alex’s auxiliary lines here is to jump too much, creating many new lines and angles that have been extended beyond the triangle. In fact, the red line already contains the auxiliary lines we would expect, yet it is also overlooked because it is so subtle. Both open-mindedness and attention to detail are essential in learning mathematics. This is the time to ask Alex: what proposition/theorem/property is this auxiliary line associated with that can be applied? If there is no answer, we need to eliminate the auxiliary line, and in the process gradually recognize the qualities of the “medium” of the auxiliary line. When we are able to connect the auxiliary line to the previous proposition, the structure of the proof becomes clear. In this case, the auxiliary line constructs an intermediate triangle, and then transitions the comparison of angles and sides from the new innermost triangle to the outer triangle. The comparison of the angles is relatively simple compared to the comparison of the sides. After the addition of the auxiliary line, the angles are the outer angles to the smaller triangle inside and the outer angles to the triangle outside, and this dual identity helps achieve the transition. The comparison of the sides looks complicated, but in fact it is also a combination of the use of the sum of any two sides being greater than the third side and the addition of inequalities, except that the intermediate medium takes a detour in its use. By studying proposition 21 in detail today, I hope Alex will be able to better understand the addition and use of auxiliary lines. Open Assignment: - In your previous homework, pick 5-10 geometric exercises which have been used in the process of proving, analyze how it has been made and how it helped achieve the transition.

Proposition 22 and Proposition 20 are a pair of proof of sufficient and necessary conditions. Previously we were talking about the fact that the sum of any two sides of any triangle is greater than the third side, while the next proposition 22 says that any three line segments must construct a triangle if the sum of two of them is greater than the third side. Also, Proposition 20 is a proof, while Proposition 22 is a construction. 12.1 Proposition 22 Out of three straight lines, which are equal to three given straight lines, to construct a triangle: thus it is necessary that two of the straight lines taken together in any manner should be greater than the remaining one. The proposition starts by drawing the given three line segments onto the same line, then taking the middle side as the base side, while moving the line segments to the position where the two circles intersect by using the property of equal radii of circles. The key to this proof is also the vertex of the new triangle constructed by the intersection of the two circles. Imagine what it would be like if the two circles did not intersect. Under what circumstances can the two circles not intersect to produce a vertex? No intersecting vertices is the equivalent of not being able to construct a closed triangle. That is, the case where the sum of the two sides is less than the third side. It is not difficult to understand, because if the sum of two sides is equal to the third side, then we see thickened line segments that overlap each other; while if the sum of two sides is less than the third side, it is an open line drawing and cannot be enclosed into a figure. As shown in the figure: So what role does the circle play in this construction process? It is both a medium to pass equivalent line segments and a means to detect the relationship between two circles, intersecting, tangent, or not intersecting nor tangent, its equivalence to the relationship of three sides also determines the construction of the triangle. 12.2 Proposition 23 On a given straight line and at a point on it to construct a rectilineal angle equal to a given rectilineal angle. Proposition 23 is not difficult, and the most worthwhile discussion here is the relationship between angles and triangles. Let’s start with Alex’s thought process on the relationship between angles and triangles, the first of which is that the interior angles of a triangle sum to one hundred and eighty degrees, and the second is that the exterior angles are larger than the other two interior angles. These first two are both properties of triangles, and the question we wish to touch on is what is an angle? Can it exist independently of the triangle? The reason for thinking about such a question is that in the proof, Euclid chose to construct the triangle and then prove that one of the angles is equal. Why do you do this? Here the angle is defined with reference to Definition 8 and Definition 9: Definition 8: A plane angle is the inclination to one another of two lines in a plane which meet one another and do not lie in a straight line. Definition 9: And when the lines containing the angle are straight, the angle is called rectilineal. Obviously, when defining angles at the very beginning, it is not necessary to place them in a figure enclosed by a straight line, such as a triangle. So what is the role of the triangle here? The triangle is the equivalent of a medium here to allow us to apply the properties of the triangle we have learned previously to compare the angles contained in it. If we compare the angles directly, we could also make an argument in terms of displacement and coincidence, but obviously Euclid was trying to avoid such a proof. If one does not compare directly, one can also compare the angles in parts by slicing them, etc.The choice of triangles here is a way of filling in the smaller parts into the larger whole to facilitate identification. These possibilities represent different ways of thinking: direct comparison method: that is, the object to be compared is compared visually and holistically detail comparison method: the details of the object to be compared are divided as needed and compared one by one filling comparison: The object to be compared is placed in a larger text/environment and selected by matching the whole or other parts. Corresponding to real life, in the school system it is an intuitive comparison of overall scores; comparison of single subject scores; looking at rankings; if applying for a job, overall impressions; resume details; teamwork performance. 12.3 Proposition 24 If two triangles have the two sides equal to two sides respectively, but have the one of the angles contained by the equal straight lines greater than the other, they will also have the base greater than the base. For proposition 24, we don’t have much to discuss. In fact, Proposition 24 and Proposition 21 echo each other. Proposition 21 looks at the size of the other two sides and the top angle after fixing the bottom side, while Proposition 24 looks at the change of the bottom side and top angle after fixing the lengths of the two sides. The key to the proof of this proposition is to put the two sides to be compared into the same triangle and then prove the relationship between the lengths of the two sides by comparing the sizes of the corresponding angles.

Proposition 24 and Proposition 25 are connected, and even very similar, in that both look at the relationship between the top and bottom angles after fixing the two sides of the triangle. Proposition 24 says that the larger top angle corresponds to the longer bottom side, while Proposition 25 proves it again in an opposite direction, that the longer bottom side corresponds to the larger top angle. If we look at Proposition 24 and Proposition 25 together, we see that both are reductio ad absurdum, and they both disprove by first eliminating equality and then eliminating the less-than case. This is where I once again ask Alex how he feels about the converse method and whether he thinks that it has sufficient explanatory power. Alex uses an analogy here: the reductio ad absurdum seems to be binary and seems to consider only 0 and 1, so what if there are other hidden cases? This question nicely reveals the limitations of reductio ad absurdum, the counterfactual, which is to prove that cases other than the statement are wrong, and therefore can only admit the correctness of the statement. The weakest part here is not proving the wrongness of the other cases, but the fact that in enumerating all cases not all possibilities are listed. In Euclid’s proof, three cases are considered, greater than, equal to, and less than. Suppose I set up an abstract world that is a replica of real life, with no identical existence, a “system of inequalities”, would I be able to never consider the case of equals when proving in this new system? In Euclid’s system, is it possible to disprove many of the propositions in the “unequal system” because of the possibility of equality? Does another new system exist that is related to the Euclidean system in the same way as the Euclidean system is related to the “unequal system”, in another way, except for the cases of greater than, less than, and equal, such as “approximately equal”? At this point, the proposition proved by the reductio ad absurdum is not invalid? But the existence of “approximately equal to” does not affect the rest of the proof? Then can we declare that the argument of the reductio ad absurdum is not convincing enough? There is one more point to ponder about Proposition 24 and Proposition 25. Why is it necessary to prove that Proposition 24 comes before Proposition 25? Can the order be reversed here? If we look at the citation in the proof, we will find that Proposition 24 needs to refer to Proposition 23, and 23 will use 22. It seems that the order of 24 before 25 has been prepared since 22. If we wish to prove the long side to the large angle (25) first and then the large angle to the long side (24), can you do it? Do you need additional propositional assistance? Alex needs to think about this carefully in class. 13.2 Proposition 26 If two triangles have the two angles equal to two angles respectively, and one side equal to one side, namely, either the side adjoining the equal angles, or that subtending one of the equal angles, they will also have the remaining sides equal to the remaining sides and the remaining angle to the remaining angle. The next proposition 26 is very long. Alex says that when he sees it, he thinks it is “long, annoying and difficult”, but in fact, long propositions are not necessarily difficult, sometimes there are short propositions that are proven in a different way, but more difficult to think about. The argument of Proposition 26 is divided into two parts, the first part is ASA and the second part is AAS, and each part proves again that in the case of ASA and AAS, respectively, the remaining parts of the triangle are equal. And the format of its proof is the same, assuming that the corresponding sides of one of the remaining sets are not equal, and setting one of them longer than the other, but this will lead to the impossibility of the corresponding angles, so the remaining sides must be equal, and then the remaining angles must also be equal. In this way, Proposition 26 is first split into two halves, each of which is not as long as the previous proposition, and then the remaining half is quickly understood by looking closely at one of the halves. This proposition complements the previous method of proving congruence, and the four methods of proving congruence are now complete: SSS, SAS, ASA, and AAS. Differently from the writing order here, in the actual class, we studied Proposition 27 and Proposition 28 with Alex first, because it happened that the math class in school was also teaching parallelism, and we not only look at Euclid’s proofs together, but also look at the proofs from the selected readings in the textbook. Comparing the two proofs, we vote unanimously for Euclid, which is more convincing and reliable. The reason why the order in which the proofs were studied could be switched here is that the farthest proposition from Proposition 27 is followed by Proposition 16, and from Proposition 17 to Proposition 25, which is not directly related to Proposition 27. We can understand it this way, even though the numbers after the propositions are sequentially increasing, and in fact two mutually undisturbed branches develop from proposition 16 onwards, one from 17 to 25, and the other direction from 27, and these two directions cross afterwards. At this point I just want Alex to notice this, and at the end of the first volume I would like Alex to make a hand-drawn or mind-mapped diagram of the connections between the propositions, looking at the logical lines of the 48 propositions in the first volume from a more macro perspective. 13.3 Proposition 27 If a straight line falling on two straight lines make the alternate angles equal to one another, the straight lines will be parallel to one another. Proposition 28 continues to develop the new branch. Proposition 27 and 28 are both related to parallelism and both are about the conditions for determining parallelism, after which we will study the properties of parallelism (Proposition 29). Here again we recall the definition of parallel lines. Definition 23: Parallel straight lines are straight lines which, being in the same plane and being produced indefinitely in both directions, do not meet one another in either direction. Just looking at Definition 23, we can also understand that this definition is not able to help us determine a set of parallel lines, because it requires that the lines remain disjoint at infinity, and our propositions in figuration are proven in the present, and therefore we need to reset other conditions of determination, equivalent to infinite extension and disjoint, or as a result of this infinite extension and disjoint is further deduced that can be placed in the zone midway between it and parallel, and that is how Proposition 27 was born. The case of reciprocal equal interior angles, where the line extends in both directions without intersecting, also satisfies the definition parallel. 13.4 Proposition 28 If a straight line falling on two straight lines make the exterior angle equal to the interior and opposite angle on the same side, or the interior angles on the same side equal to two right angles, the straight lines will be parallel to one another. Proposition 28 can actually be split into two sub-propositions: congruent angles are equal and the two lines are parallel. two lines are parallel if the interior angles are complementary Instead of proving parallelism directly by definition, this proof is converted into Proposition 27 to prove parallelism, making the steps more concise.

Proposition 29 then discusses the properties of parallel lines and integrates the three properties in one proposition. Propositions 27, 28, and 29 form a set of sufficient and necessary conditions, the concept that we have learned in previous classes. 14.1 Proposition 29 A straight line falling on parallel straight lines makes the alternate angles equal to one another, the exterior angle equal to the interior and opposite angle, and the interior angles on the same side equal to two right angles. Proposition 29 applies a filling comparison method in which we need to prove equality by adding angles and combining them again. 14.2 Proposition 30 Straight lines parallel to the same straight line are also parallel to one another. Proposition 30 is a further corollary using the nature of parallelism. Here we recall Common Notion 1: Things which are equal to the same thing are also equal to one another. This common notion is written in the same way as the statement of Proposition 30: “Straight lines parallel to the same straight line are also parallel to one another.” What does this tell us? Does the convincingness of this proof go beyond Common Notion 1? (Why does it feel as if it doesn’t?) Let’s imagine that lines A and B each extend never to intersect, but that line C, the projection of line A onto line B, is parallel to A and intersects C. Don’t be confused by this idea, however, because going back to the definition of parallel, (a parallel line is a line in the same plane that extends infinitely in both directions and does not intersect each other.) It is required that the lines be in the same plane. Even though proposition 30 does not spell out the implied condition of the same plane, it nevertheless exists, and thus this imagery is excluded from Euclid’s world. Isn’t it true that you always want to find a break in Euclid but end up admiring the rigor of the system? 14.3 Proposition 31 Through a given point to draw a straight line parallel to a given straight line. The proof of Proposition 31 is easy and pleasant, and the question worth discussing here is whether one parallel line can be drawn passing a fixed point, corresponding to one line? What does this uniqueness mean here? When we were studying the definition of parallelism, we discussed whether we could replace the statement “two directions extend but do not intersect” with “the distance between the corresponding points on two lines is always equal”. Can we sense the property that “the distance between the corresponding points on two lines is always equal”? Then why did Euclid not define it in this way? In my opinion, the problem goes back to Definition 4: A straight line is a line which lies evenly with the points on itself. Euclid does not fully define the relationship between lines and points, we are not able to equate the equal distance between infinitely connected points to the distance between two straight lines. This great point-to-line gap is the difficulty in defining parallel lines. Also, Proposition 12 (To a given infinite straight line, from a given point which is not on it, to draw a perpendicular straight line), the perpendicular line also seems to be unique and the perpendicular line is made by proving that two adjacent angles are equal to each other. Parallel lines, on the other hand, are proved by proving that interior angles are equal. In Proposition 22 we have seen the circuit from lines to angles to graphs, and the proofs here for drawing perpendicular and drawing parallel lines imply that the circuit from angles to lines is also connected. 14.4 Proposition 32 In any triangle, if one of the sides be produced, the exterior angle is equal to the two interior and opposite angles, and the three interior angles of the triangle are equal to two right angles. Proposition 32 is a two-part proposition. It takes up Proposition 16 (In any triangle, if one of the sides be produced, the exterior angle is greater than either of the interior and opposite angles) and Proposition 17 (In any triangle two angles taken together in any manner are less than two right angles). We will find that when we finish proving Proposition 32, we won’t call 16 and 17 very often later, because it is included by default in what Proposition 32 involves: the outer angle is equal to the sum of the two inner opposite angles, which is naturally greater than either inner angle, and the sum of the three inner angles is equal to the two right angles, so the sum of any two of the three angles is necessarily less than the two inner angles. Although it may seem that Proposition 16,17 to Proposition 32 is just a small step forward, the process is too arduous to be omitted. It’s as if you’ve taken an umbrella from the skeleton to the top, seemingly just covering the umbrella, but the top requires a multi-step process to realize it before it can be put on the frame. Regarding proposition 32, Alex comes up with a different method of proof on his own, which is also very feasible: "],["discussion-xv-prop-33-36.html", "Chapter 15 Discussion XV (Prop 33-36) 15.1 Proposition 33 15.2 Proposition 34", " Chapter 15 Discussion XV (Prop 33-36) The propositions in this lesson are about parallelograms. We have divided the propositions to be examined today into two groups: Propositions 33 and 34, a group on the definition and properties of parallelograms; and Propositions 35 and 36, a group on the transfer of the concept of equal areas. 15.1 Proposition 33 The straight lines joining equal and parallel straight lines [at the extremities which are] in the same directions [respectively] are themselves also equal and parallel. 15.2 Proposition 34 In parallelogrammic areas the opposite sides and angles are equal to one another, and the diameter bisects the areas. After exploring the triangle and parallel lines, it’s the turn to parallelogram, however, it is interesting that if we look back at the order of the definition, parallelogram actually existed in the definition of 22, but it appeared before the parallel straight line, and did not appear under the name parallelogram, and the concept of parallelism is not used in the definition – a rhomboid that which has its opposite sides and angles equal to one another but is neither equilateral nor right- angled? (Excerpt definition XXII), here we may stop a little bit, just to think about: for a quadrilateral with equal opposite angles and sides, the two sets of sides are necessarily parallel or not? So why didn’t we prove parallelism through parallelograms before? Instead, we went through the relations of alternate interior angles, corresponding angles, and interior angles on the same side? Recall here Proposition XXIII: On a given straight line and at a point on it to construct a rectilineal angle equal to a given rectilineal angle. In this proof Euclid is putting the angle inside a triangle and proving that the two linear angles are equal by proving that the triangles are congruent. Probably there is one difference between triangles and parallelograms. A parallelogram is a set of two parallel lines, and a set of parallel lines can exist independently; a parallelogram emerges when two sets of parallel lines cross under certain circumstances. While two sets of parallel lines depend on each other to produce a new figure, the concept of parallelism is independent from the quadrilateral. A triangle is a figure that can be considered as a straight line folded twice, with its associated extensions, exterior angles, etc., all dependent on the triangle, which itself can no longer be disassembled. Because a triangle can be used as a basic unit, but a parallelogram cannot. Thus, in the study of propositions, we first understand the concept of parallelism, then build another set of parallel lines on a set of parallel lines to construct a parallelogram, and then prove that its properties satisfy the part of the definition that “opposite sides and angles equal to one another but is neither equilateral nor right- angled”. It is only after this that the two concepts overlap and the role from known to proved is completed. Proposition 33 builds a parallelogram on the basis of parallelism, while Proposition 34 proves that the opposite sides of a parallelogram are equal to each other. Interestingly, Proposition33 does not mention “parallelogram” in the text, but only says another set of parallel and equal sides, while Proposition 34 starts with the region of parallelogram immediately after. In Proposition 34, “area” appears and is not defined, but evolves into area later, so let’s describe it by “area”, that is, the place where the circle is defined. We have talked before about the bisector of an angle and the bisector of a line, but for the first time we are talking about the bisector of a figure. In Proposition 9, we used two congruent triangles to confirm that the plane angles are bisected, that is, we first confirmed the equality of the two figures and then took out the angular parts of them. And here, for the first time, we talk directly about the graphs (“area”). Here it can trigger countless imaginations and thoughts about what this graph looks like. Is it an illusion or a solid, is it a closed content enclosed by lines like a fence? Or is it an inseparable existence closely linked to the lines? Can it be separated from the figure itself? In life it seems that examples of both can be found, such as a yard, then the lines are the fence, and the calculation of the area within the yard is separate from the wall itself, because one wants to know the area of land in the yard and how many plants and flowers can be planted. And if we buy a birthday cake, it is another thing. The edge of the cake and the cake itself is a whole, the figure and the edge are continuous together, we abstract the yard and the cake separately, both are geometric figures, while the relationship between the edge and the inner area is very different, what kind of thinking can this bring us?

"],["proposition-36.html", "Chapter 17 Proposition 36", " Chapter 17 Proposition 36 Parallelograms which are on equal bases and in the same parallels are equal to one another. Next, we try to prove Proposition 35 and 36, which its methods are not difficult. Proposition 35 is proved by subtracting equal quantities and adding equal quantities to equal quantities, while Proposition 36 builds on the previous proposition and only needs to find a suitable medium as an intermediate bridge. It is interesting to see the expansion of the concept of equality. The act of comparison - equivalence - was never defined; it seems to be taken directly from the real-life concept and used. Most of the things we proved before were equal because they overlapped, that is, it was hoped that the parts proved to be equal could be used as a continuous whole, with each uncuttable part corresponding to the other. Because overlapping objects are separable, then after motion, the two objects that first overlap and then do not overlap are equal. Here the separation motion has an assumed premise that its separation must be without any loss. For example, translation, flip, and symmetry of these movements, we assume that in the abstract geometric world, will not produce any loss of energy, which will have the equivalence after the separation of the movement. (For a displaced object, there is also such a premise of motion, we assumed that the object has no loss in displacement, otherwise it would not be the same before the motion and it would be the same after the motion) The first step of equivalence is from coincidence to partial separation, which is the same base in Proposition 35, and then comes the complete separation, which has become equal in Proposition 36 At the same time, in both propositions, it is implied that the case of detachment from the shackles of shape, the same base but the angles are not different, and the parallelogram with the same base between the same set of parallel lines, which does not have the same shape, and their equivalence is also proved in Proposition 35, is done by splicing, which means that we can combine two parallelograms by cutting them and the parts they are divided into, are identical in shape, thus introducing the equivalence of the whole. This is an example of changing perspective and going back to the local and microscopic parts for proof. If we endorse such a leap of logic, then geometry will break through the limits of our vision and take us on to situations approaching infinity. Imagine a parallelogram close to a straight line with a fixed base and a side close to infinity in length. Although it is not known exactly how long it is, its area is known because it can be known from other parallelograms between the same base and the same set of parallelograms, a jump from infinity to finite that is well worth thinking about.

What is interesting, however, is that if we look at the first volume with a macroscopic view, it basically follows the sequence from angles to figures, and then each jump can again be reverted back a small step to further illustrate the previous partial properties. In fact, this also gives us a life and learning inspiration, some results are a part of the fine processing to get, while some results of the discovery need to cross the perspective to look. For the same piece of knowledge, it does not require a full comprehension, to learn deeper and further and then come back will help the understanding. Another controversial point in Proposition 37 is the last step, whether we can use the argument “half of equal quantities are equal” without reasoning. In the common notions, the operation of equal quantities does not involve multiplication and division, but only the addition and subtraction of equal quantities are equal. We can rewrite the argument to say that equal quantities are equal after subtracting half of them, which is the application of Common Notion 3. This is the part of the parallelogram mentioned in Proposition 34 where the diagonal bisects the parallelogram. Note that the rewriting of Common Notion 3 is controversial here, but it is reasonable here because the parallelogram is proved in Proposition 34. 18.2 Proposition 38 Triangles which are on equal bases and in the same parallels are equal to one another. The order of Propositions 37 and 38 is an exact copy of Proposition 35 and Proposition 36. The same as Proposition 37, Proposition 38 only ends the proof by adding the last sentence that half of the equal quantities are also equal on the basis of proving that parallelograms are equal under the same conditions, thus the same method and arguments will not be repeated here. 18.3 Proposition 39 Equal triangles which are on the same base and on the same side are also in the same parallels. The previous proposition was to prove the connection between triangles by the relation between parallel lines and base sides, but now, proposition 39, it is to restrict the triangle to see parallel lines. Let’s think about what parallel lines mean. First, if we just have two triangles with the same side and the same base, the common base is part of one of the parallel lines, and then the other parallel line is not shown at the beginning (note that it cannot be said that it does not exist here, because it is always there, it is just a matter of whether we find it and mark it), it is necessary to connect the vertices of the two triangles in order to draw part of this parallel line. Then the parallel line drawn actually defines to some extent the domain of the triangle, that is, the upper and lower boundaries, and this found boundary has a parallel relationship between them. What can this teach us? Suppose we are looking at a thing, then we also have to think about the nature of the larger range of things that are not accidentally related. From the previous proposition, we know that the property of connecting the vertices of two triangles to appear here is not a coincidence, and this necessity is the direction and content of the new proposition that deserves to be made explicit. 18.4 Proposition 40 Equal triangles which are on equal bases and on the same side are also in the same parallels. The origin of Proposition 40 is doubtful, and it is recorded as a late addition by the editor. However, it follows Proposition 39, and its parallel transformation from “same base” to “equal base” is consistent with the style of Euclid’s previous proofs. I personally think that even if it is added by the editor, there is nothing wrong with keeping it. 18.5 Proposition 41 If a parallelogram have the same base with a triangle and be in the same parallels, the parallelogram is double of the triangle. After proving parallelograms and triangles in the case of equal bases and between the same set of parallel lines separately, (with the additional content of proving parallel lines in an opposite way), finally we see the proof that integrates parallelograms and triangles together. Proposition 41 qualifies the condition of congruent bases and parallel lines, and carries out a corollary of Propositions 35 and 37. It is worth noting here the concept of doubling, not forgetting our historical question about the discussion of “area” in Proposition 34, whether the area of the figure can be compared here, and what is the baseline for comparison? Although the issue of area units is never mentioned in the book, are they assumed to exist when we make comparisons? This point has never been taken seriously, and the issue of units will be explored further in the definitions in Volume 5.。 18.6 Proposition 42 To construct, in a given rectilineal angle, a parallelogram equal to given triangle. The entire book begins with the construction of an equilateral triangle on a straight line. It also makes us wonder if the point of mathematics is to discover or to create, or to reuse? This also has been a question that I leave Alex to think about. Later we also construct triangles here (Proposition 22), straight line angles (Proposition 34), draw parallel lines, etc. Here the parallelogram is constructed, but two qualifications are given, one to limit the size of the angle, the other is to limit the size of the area. Because the previous proposition has proved that, on the same base line and within the same set of parallel lines, the area of parallelograms is twice as the triangles, then it is natural that the area of a parallelogram with half the base is equal to that of a triangle within the same set of parallelograms, so it is only necessary to make the angles equal in size to the given angles when drawing the parallelogram. From Proposition 35 to this proposition, it is all about the back and forth transformation of quadrilaterals and triangles between the same set of parallelograms, and the repeated application of a group of translational transformation techniques, from overlap to partial separation to complete separation, to comparison between the whole and the parts, and stopping at reinvention, that is, at creation. The purpose of mathematics is not only to help us perceive the laws of nature, but from the beginning it has the meaning of recreation. "],["discussion-xvii-prop-43-45.html", "Chapter 19 Discussion XVII (Prop 43-45) 19.1 Proposition 43 19.2 Proposition 44 19.3 Proposition 45", " Chapter 19 Discussion XVII (Prop 43-45) Following the last discussion, we are still focused on parallelogram in this class, and we learn and discuss Proposition 42 to 45. 19.1 Proposition 43 In any parallelogram the complements of the parallelograms about the diameter are equal to one another. Proposition 43 is summed up in one sentence by repeatedly applying Common notion 3. The remainder of equal quantities minus equal quantities minus equal quantities again is always equal. When a set of congruent triangles is subtracted from two sets of lesser congruent triangles, the area of the remaining quadrilateral is still equal. The proof is not difficult, just remember the areas which the new concept of complementary shape refers to. The other thing is that this proposition is a good illustration of the concept of separation of area and shape. The two complementary shapes are equal in area but different in shape, implying that the concept of equality in mathematics focuses on area (quality) rather than shape (form), and that mathematics wants to think about and compare content beyond visual awareness. 19.2 Proposition 44 To a given straight line to apply, in a given rectilineal angle, a parallelogram equal to a given triangle. Proposition 44 is an upgraded version of Proposition 42, which limits the size and area of the angles to draw parallelograms under the condition that they have the same base as the known triangle. Proposition 44, here once again, moves the position of the base, that is, separates it from the triangle more completely, keeping only the relationship on the area, while there is no connection on the position at all. In conjunction with the previous propositions, it can be seen that Euclid’s proofs all eventually move toward independence, finding connections while leaving them separate to be able to exist alone without interference. So why is this proposition not proved immediately after the proof of 42? Here is a review of what has been said before. Because proposition 43 is also part of the reasoning, and the fact that proposition 43 is separated out also indicates that it has its own value of the independent existence and may be repeatedly referenced later by other proofs. If we put the whole contents of volume I together and draw all the propositional statements, then it is also a big exposition in itself, yet we cut it again into different parts and make statements for better repeated use of a certain part, which is easy to locate and find. (The same is true for programming to write code) 19.3 Proposition 45 To construct, in a given rectilineal angle, a parallelogram equal to a given rectilineal figure. Proposition 45 further breaks the restriction by not only separating the known and the desired completely, but also by redefining the known part irregularly. The graph breaks the limits of the triangle, but is equal to just any linear shape. And the most interesting method here lies in separation and reorganization. That is, you can first satisfy other conditions by drawing line segments and figures separately, and then later reverse the process by proving that the straight line angle is equal to two right angles, so it is the same straight line and then merge the separated figures together. This tip also applies to the practice of geometry exercises in middle school, when drawing the auxiliary line is done to extend or first meet other conditions and then prove that it is on the extension line, which is a problem of skillful choice. Proposition 45 is the last proposition before the square appears. This proposition ends with a recreation, and although I am repeating it, this philosophical question is really important and deserves to be thought about again and again: what is the meaning of mathematics? "],["discussion-xviii-prop-46-48.html", "Chapter 20 Discussion XVIII (Prop 46-48) 20.1 Proposition 46 20.2 Proposition 47 20.3 Proposition 48", " Chapter 20 Discussion XVIII (Prop 46-48) The three propositions at the end of Volume I are all related to squares, and the most important one is Proposition 47, which we know as the Pythagorean Theorem. When we talk about Proposition 47, we will add an understanding of the ancient Chinese method of proving the Pythagorean theorem and look at the similarities and differences between Chinese and Western thinking. 20.1 Proposition 46 On a given straight line to describe a square. There is a trap in Proposition 46, and as expected, Alex stepped on it immediately. Because drawing a square is not a difficult task, it’s just a matter of repeating the drawing of right angles and cutting equal line segments. The trap here is that after drawing it, you have to prove to the reader and audience that it is a square. At first glance it seems a bit confusing, but it actually means that we will first identify four points and three sides, and the last side is obtained by joining two points, then we need to add the information that proves the two right angles related to the last side and that this side is equal to the other three sides. If you say that your last side is also obtained by drawing right angles, or making equal line segments, then you need to prove that two line segments made perpendicular from each of the two bottom edges will in fact recombine into one, which is what you have drawn. Or you prove that a line segment from a vertex that is equal to the remaining three sides, the other endpoint of this line segment coincides with a known endpoint, i.e., exactly the other of the three known vertices. No matter how you treat them, it seems that the overlap reasoning of the latter two proofs require reductio ad absurdum method, which is troublesome and the persuasive is not more powerful than direct proof, so we will still choose to connect the two endpoints to make up the last line segment, and then directly prove that all four angles are right angles, all four sides are equal, then the graph is a square. Here’s an interesting question about moments: did the square become a square when you finished drawing the line segments, or did it become a square after you finished the proof? How should this moment of factual completion and the moment of argument completion be understood? Here, what I want Alex to think about is the meaning of communication and the value of language. It is as if a herb medicine has been in the mountains and no one has told the herbalist that it is in fact a herb medicine and has all kinds of magical properties. Then the herb medicine is not a “medicine” but a “plant” until it is defined and popularized, and you will find that at this time, things are defined by the user, not by their existence. By the same token, in this problem, when the drawing is finished, we have drawn a figure because it is not yet “recognized” as a square, but when we have finished proving it, it really “is” a square. (The meaning of education, diploma, skill certificate in life is also the same.) 20.2 Proposition 47 In right-angled triangles the square on the side subtending the right angle is equal to the squares on the sides containing the right angle. Proposition 47 is the culminating part of Volume I. The proof is completed by the correspondence between the areas of parallelograms and triangles. This proposition mainly invokes Proposition 41 and Proposition 46, where the previous proposition - Proposition 46 - is basically unrelated to the recent ones and can be understood as written separately for Proposition 47. And propositions 42 to 45 are mainly working on re-creation (the non-constructed propositions are also preparing for the constructed propositions). Therefore, Proposition 47 is a question in the main line of proof, if we consider “re-creation” as a branch of the proof in Volume 1. Taking Proposition 48 at the end of the first volume backwards through the references, the line of logical development can be seen. The main line is naturally the longest one, and this longest line of proof ends with Proposition 1. Other different lines of proof have their own purpose in the proof of 47. 20.3 Proposition 48 If in a triangle the square on one of the sides be equal to the squares on the remaining two sides of the triangle, the angle contained by the remaining two sides of the triangle is right. The reason for this lineage is to show how the western Pythagorean theorem progresses from zero to the completion of the proof in the middle of the process. The ancient Chinese method of proof, on the other hand, is very different, taking Liu Hui’s cut-and-patch technique as an example. (Picture?) The characteristic of the cut-and-patch technique is that it starts from a practical point of view and completely omits the construction of the abstract world, so it does not need a series of proof definitions to lay the groundwork, it just gives the figure and uses the piecing method to prove it. And it assumes the meaning of visual cognition, thinking that it can directly determine the equivalence of different parts of “in” and “out” without giving a proof. The ancient Chinese method is relatively practical, easy to understand, and related to hands-on skills. If we read “The Nine Chapters of Arithmetic”, we will find that the whole book starts from a practical problem of life, such as calculating the area of a field, which actually leads to a thought: Western proof-based mathematics and ancient Chinese applied mathematics are both known today as mathematics, but are they really talking about the same thing? Proposition 48 is the conclusion of the whole volume, which is actually a counter-proof of Proposition 47, replacing the condition and the conclusion, if the certain property proved in Proposition 47 exists, then the certain condition must also be satisfied. Therefore, when we take 48 as the starting point to organize the whole volume, we find that the core falls in the proof of 47. 48 is, moreover, a presentation of Euclid’s habit of giving the opposite, related, extended and recreated proofs when an important proof is completed. At this point, all 48 propositions of the first volume have been discussed. "],["references.html", "References", " References Euclid, Euclid’s Elements: all thirteen books complete in one volume, tr.
